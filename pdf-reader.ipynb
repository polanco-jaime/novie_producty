Employing a Geographic Regression Discontinuity Design, we capture the local impact of exploration announcements and establish a causal relationship. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in dropout rates among elementary school pupils, with a more pronounced effect observed among girls. However, an increase in dropout rates is observed among secondary school pupils. These results highlight the complex and nuanced relationship between natural resources and educational outcomes, suggesting the presence of underlying factors influencing dropout rates at different stages of schooling. These findings underscore the critical importance of incorporating the impact of expected income shocks in educational policy formulation, particularly within exploration and explotaition of natural resources areas.

This paper corresponds to my Job Market Paper. ‡Researcher at Banco de la Republica de Colombia, cpossosu@banrep.gov.co 1 1 Introduction The relationship between economic activities and educational outcomes has been a topic of significant interest in the field of economics. Understanding how different economic sectors influence educational outcomes is crucial for policymakers and researchers alike. In the context of Colombia, a country with a long history of oil and gas production, exploring the impact of hydrocarbon exploration on dropout rates and academic performance is particularly relevant. Colombia has substantial dependence on hydrocarbon resources, which constitute a significant portion of its export earnings and government revenues, highlighting the need to comprehensively examine the consequences of oil price fluctuations and demand shocks on the educational sector. Research conducted by Quintero Otero (2020) reveals that oil price dynamics resulting from specific demand shocks can lead to substantial cumulative impacts on the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), underscoring the significant economic implications for educational outcomes. In Colombia, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) plays a pivotal role in regulating the oil and gas industry.   \\' \n",

These sleep disturbances may have serious negative consequences, including postnatal depression. Disturbances may be long-lasting, with one study finding that, based on parental reports, 41% of children with sleeping disturbance at 8 months still had difficulties at 3 years.7 Studies of sleep achievement show that all individuals, including babies, “learn” to fall asleep with certain external environmental The Medical Journal of Australia ISSN: cues.1,8,9 Sleep initiation is repeated several 0025-729X 7 March 2005 182 5 215-218 times during the night, as all individuals ©The Medical Journal of Australia 2005 repeatedly awaken for brief periods.

    "3. Abstract summary: A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of a consultation teaching behaviour modification program in improving sleep performance in newborns. The intervention group (n = 40) received a consultation teaching behaviour modification program, while the control group (n = 40) received a standard care control. The primary outcome was the number of nights per week that the infant slept for 5 hours or more. The secondary outcomes were the number of nights per week that the infant cried for 30 minutes or more, the number of nights per week that the infant woke up more than 3 times, and the number of nights per week that the infant woke up before 6 am. The intervention group had significantly more nights per week that the infant slept for 5 hours or more (mean difference 1.5, 95% confidence interval 0.6-2.4, P = 0.005) and fewer nights per week that the infant cried for 30 minutes or more (mean difference 0.6, 95% confidence interval 0.1-1.1, P = 0.02). There were no significant differences between the groups for the number of nights per week that the infant woke up more than 3 times or the number of nights per week that the infant woke up before 6 am.\n",

Using a novel data-driven methodology, the authors identify two main sets of green skills, namely, engineering skills for the design and production of technology, and managerial skills for implementing and monitoring environmental organizational practices. Exploiting exogenous geographical variation in regulatory stringency, the authors also evaluate the effect of environmental regulation on the demand of green skills for a panel of US metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas over the period 2006–14. The main finding is that while these changes in environmental regulation have no impact on overall employment, they create significant, if modest, gaps in the demand for some green skills, especially those related to technical and engineering work tasks.\n",

    "2. Abstract summary: The green economic transformation needed to achieve net zero emissions will also require changes in employment. This chapter examines the labor market implications of this transition, using a mix of empirical and model-based analyses. Looking at a sample of largely advanced economies, the empirical analysis indicates that both greener and more polluting jobs are concentrated among small subsets of workers. Individual workers face tough challenges in moving to greener jobs from more pollution-intensive jobs, complicating labor reallocation. Higher skills make job transitions easier, highlighting the potential importance of training. Stronger environmental policies help green the labor market and appear more effective when reallocation incentives are not blunted. Finally, a policy package incorporating a green infrastructure push, phased-in carbon prices, and targeted training and an earned income tax credit to provide income support and incentivize labor supply could put an economy on a path to net zero emissions by 2050, with an inclusive transition. Model simulations for a representative advanced economy suggest that about 1 percent of employment would shift toward greener activities over a 10-year period. By contrast, for a representative emerging market economy, about 2.5 percent of employment would shift, reflecting differences in workforce skills and greater reliance on higher-emissions-intensive production. Delays in policy actions will require sharper labor market adjustments to achieve net zero emissions.\n",

    "output_text: \"The reviewed literature presents two distinct papers that contribute to the understanding of the relationship between environmental considerations and the labor market. Both papers explore the intricate interplay between environmental regulations, employment dynamics, and the skills required for a sustainable economic transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper titled \"Environmental Regulation and Green Skills: An Empirical Exploration\" by Vona, Marin, Consoli, and Popp (Year) investigates the impact of environmental regulations on the demand for specific skills within the workforce. The authors employ a novel data-driven methodology to identify two primary categories of green skills: engineering skills for technological design and production, and managerial skills for the implementation and monitoring of environmentally conscious practices. Through a thorough evaluation of regulatory stringency, the study unveils the effect of environmental regulations on the demand for green skills across US metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The main finding underscores that while these regulations do not influence overall employment levels, they do create notable disparities in the demand for certain green skills, particularly those associated with technical and engineering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second paper, \"A GREENER LABOR MARKET: EMPLOYMENT, POLICIES, AND ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION\" by Bluedorn, Hansen, Noureldin, Shibata, Tavares, Newman, and Nyakeri (Year), delves into the labor market implications of the essential shift towards a greener economy to achieve net zero emissions. Drawing upon a combination of empirical analyses and model-based simulations, the authors assess the challenges and opportunities posed by this transformation. They reveal that the labor market is marked by a concentration of both greener and more polluting jobs within specific worker subsets. The transition from pollution-intensive jobs to greener alternatives is complex, accentuating the need for effective training and skill enhancement. Furthermore, the paper highlights the influence of environmental policies on the labor market's transition. It suggests that policy interventions such as a green infrastructure push, phased-in carbon prices, targeted training, and an earned income tax credit can lead to a labor market aligned with sustainability goals. The study's findings are supported by model simulations that predict shifts in employment distribution based on the level of economic development and workforce skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the examined literature provides valuable insights into the relationship between environmental concerns and labor market dynamics. The papers collectively emphasize the critical role of skills and policy interventions in facilitating the transition to a sustainable economy while navigating challenges posed by environmental regulations and the complex restructuring of the labor market. The findings from these studies contribute to the discourse on achieving economic transformation while addressing environmental imperatives and ensuring equitable labor market outcomes.\"\n",

Using a novel data-driven methodology, the authors identify two main sets of green skills, namely, engineering skills for the design and production of technology, and managerial skills for implementing and monitoring environmental organizational practices. Exploiting exogenous geographical variation in regulatory stringency, the authors also evaluate the effect of environmental regulation on the demand of green skills for a panel of US metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas over the period 2006–14. The main finding is that while these changes in environmental regulation have no impact on overall employment, they create significant, if modest, gaps in the demand for some green skills, especially those related to technical and engineering work tasks.\n",

Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial Medical Journal of Australia, 2005; 182 (5):215-218 This article is available from the Medical Journal of Australia at: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/effect-consultation-teaching-behaviour-modification- sleep-performance-infants PERMISSIONS This document has been archived with permission from the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia, ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the effect of a behaviour modification program, taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse, in improving sleep performance in newborn infants. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper. Intervention: A 45-minute consultation with a nurse 2–3 weeks after the birth, including a tutorial discussion on normal sleep patterns in newborn infants, supported by retained written material and, for infants with weight gain < 30 g daily, referral to their usual postnatal care provider. Main outcome measures: Hours of daytime sleep (0600–1800), night sleep (1800–0600) and total sleep per 24 h; and number of daily records with total sleep (cid:1) 15 h per 24 h, assessed by 7-day sleep diary at ages 6 and 12 weeks. Results: 268 families returned at least one sleep diary (137/171 intervention, 131/175 control), recording 3273 days. Two intervention infants were referred for low weight gain. Total sleep time was 15 h or more per 24 h on 62% of recorded days in the intervention group, compared with 36% in the control group (P < 0.001). At 6 weeks of age, intervention infants slept a mean 1.3 h per day more than control infants (95% CI, 0.95– 1.65), comprising a mean 0.5 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.32–0.69) and 0.8 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.56–1.07). At 12 weeks, intervention infants slept a mean 1.2 h per day more (95% CI, 0.94–2.14), comprising 0.64 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.19–0.89) and 0.58 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.39–1.03). There was no significant difference in crying time between the groups. Conclusions: A single consultation supported by written material in the first 3 weeks of a child’s life improves sleep performance at 6 weeks of age. This improvement is maintained at 3 months. METHODS Study population Families were recruited from birth notifica- tions published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the only South Australian daily newspaper, between October 1996 and March 1997. Contact details were obtained from the tele- phone directory. Parents were contacted by telephone within 2 weeks of their child’s birth and invited to participate in a study of sleep performance in healthy newborns. Those who agreed to participate were asked about MJA 2005; 182: 215–218 the baby’s health and medical history. Those who refused were not formally asked for their reasons. Inclusion criteria included delivery at 36– 42 weeks’ gestation, English-speaking mother, telephone in the home, and the mother intending to provide full-time care to her infant for at least the first 12 weeks after birth. A criterion for exclusion was admission of the infant to a neonatal inten- sive care unit for illness within the first 2 weeks after birth. Parents who agreed to participate were mailed a consent form. A sample size of 130 per group was determined, based on the minimum number of participants required to detect a predicted effect of a 30% increase in the proportion of children achieving 15 hours of sleep per 24 hours with a power of 90%.14 The period of 15 hours was chosen empirically as a refer- ence point based on clinical experience.

Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper.

Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial Medical Journal of Australia, 2005; 182 (5):215-218 This article is available from the Medical Journal of Australia at: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/effect-consultation-teaching-behaviour-modification- sleep-performance-infants PERMISSIONS This document has been archived with permission from the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia, ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the effect of a behaviour modification program, taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse, in improving sleep performance in newborn infants. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper. Intervention: A 45-minute consultation with a nurse 2–3 weeks after the birth, including a tutorial discussion on normal sleep patterns in newborn infants, supported by retained written material and, for infants with weight gain < 30 g daily, referral to their usual postnatal care provider. Main outcome measures: Hours of daytime sleep (0600–1800), night sleep (1800–0600) and total sleep per 24 h; and number of daily records with total sleep (cid:1) 15 h per 24 h, assessed by 7-day sleep diary at ages 6 and 12 weeks. Results: 268 families returned at least one sleep diary (137/171 intervention, 131/175 control), recording 3273 days. Two intervention infants were referred for low weight gain. Total sleep time was 15 h or more per 24 h on 62% of recorded days in the intervention group, compared with 36% in the control group (P < 0.001). At 6 weeks of age, intervention infants slept a mean 1.3 h per day more than control infants (95% CI, 0.95– 1.65), comprising a mean 0.5 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.32–0.69) and 0.8 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.56–1.07). At 12 weeks, intervention infants slept a mean 1.2 h per day more (95% CI, 0.94–2.14), comprising 0.64 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.19–0.89) and 0.58 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.39–1.03). There was no significant difference in crying time between the groups. Conclusions: A single consultation supported by written material in the first 3 weeks of a child’s life improves sleep performance at 6 weeks of age. This improvement is maintained at 3 months. METHODS Study population Families were recruited from birth notifica- tions published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the only South Australian daily newspaper, between October 1996 and March 1997. Contact details were obtained from the tele- phone directory. Parents were contacted by telephone within 2 weeks of their child’s birth and invited to participate in a study of sleep performance in healthy newborns. Those who agreed to participate were asked about MJA 2005; 182: 215–218 the baby’s health and medical history. Those who refused were not formally asked for their reasons. Inclusion criteria included delivery at 36– 42 weeks’ gestation, English-speaking mother, telephone in the home, and the mother intending to provide full-time care to her infant for at least the first 12 weeks after birth. A criterion for exclusion was admission of the infant to a neonatal inten- sive care unit for illness within the first 2 weeks after birth. Parents who agreed to participate were mailed a consent form. A sample size of 130 per group was determined, based on the minimum number of participants required to detect a predicted effect of a 30% increase in the proportion of children achieving 15 hours of sleep per 24 hours with a power of 90%.14 The period of 15 hours was chosen empirically as a refer- ence point based on clinical experience.

The analysis relies on the Student Enrollment System in Colombia (SIMAT) data, covering the period from 2012 to 2020. This dataset offers valuable insights into student enrollment trends and characteristics, particularly for schools located near areas undergoing exploration and production (E\\&P) activities. Additionally, the integration of the E\\&P contracts in Colombia dataset, obtained from the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), enables the examination of the relationship between contract signing dates and dropout rates during the preliminary phase. Furthermore, the georeferenced base of school locations provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) allows for spatial analysis and the investigation of the spatial distribution of schools in relation to E\\&P contract areas. The comprehensive database employed in this study comprises an extensive range of columns that contain valuable information essential for understanding various aspects of the educational landscape. Notably, it provides insights into school dropout rates, gender distribution, and the total number of students. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive overview of enrollment status within the same school and sheds light on migration and immigration patterns. The inclusion of demographic data, such as socioeconomic stratum, age, subsidy type, and geographic details related to school campuses, further enriches the dataset.

Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial Medical Journal of Australia, 2005; 182 (5):215-218 This article is available from the Medical Journal of Australia at: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/effect-consultation-teaching-behaviour-modification- sleep-performance-infants PERMISSIONS This document has been archived with permission from the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia, ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the effect of a behaviour modification program, taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse, in improving sleep performance in newborn infants. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper. Intervention: A 45-minute consultation with a nurse 2–3 weeks after the birth, including a tutorial discussion on normal sleep patterns in newborn infants, supported by retained written material and, for infants with weight gain < 30 g daily, referral to their usual postnatal care provider. Main outcome measures: Hours of daytime sleep (0600–1800), night sleep (1800–0600) and total sleep per 24 h; and number of daily records with total sleep (cid:1) 15 h per 24 h, assessed by 7-day sleep diary at ages 6 and 12 weeks. Results: 268 families returned at least one sleep diary (137/171 intervention, 131/175 control), recording 3273 days. Two intervention infants were referred for low weight gain. Total sleep time was 15 h or more per 24 h on 62% of recorded days in the intervention group, compared with 36% in the control group (P < 0.001). At 6 weeks of age, intervention infants slept a mean 1.3 h per day more than control infants (95% CI, 0.95– 1.65), comprising a mean 0.5 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.32–0.69) and 0.8 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.56–1.07). At 12 weeks, intervention infants slept a mean 1.2 h per day more (95% CI, 0.94–2.14), comprising 0.64 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.19–0.89) and 0.58 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.39–1.03). There was no significant difference in crying time between the groups. Conclusions: A single consultation supported by written material in the first 3 weeks of a child’s life improves sleep performance at 6 weeks of age. This improvement is maintained at 3 months. METHODS Study population Families were recruited from birth notifica- tions published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the only South Australian daily newspaper, between October 1996 and March 1997. Contact details were obtained from the tele- phone directory. Parents were contacted by telephone within 2 weeks of their child’s birth and invited to participate in a study of sleep performance in healthy newborns. Those who agreed to participate were asked about MJA 2005; 182: 215–218 the baby’s health and medical history. Those who refused were not formally asked for their reasons. Inclusion criteria included delivery at 36– 42 weeks’ gestation, English-speaking mother, telephone in the home, and the mother intending to provide full-time care to her infant for at least the first 12 weeks after birth. A criterion for exclusion was admission of the infant to a neonatal inten- sive care unit for illness within the first 2 weeks after birth. Parents who agreed to participate were mailed a consent form. A sample size of 130 per group was determined, based on the minimum number of participants required to detect a predicted effect of a 30% increase in the proportion of children achieving 15 hours of sleep per 24 hours with a power of 90%.14 The period of 15 hours was chosen empirically as a refer- ence point based on clinical experience.

Correspondence: Dr Brian G Symon, 84 Shipsters Road, Kensington Park, SA 5068. brian.symon@adelaide.edu.au R ES E A R C H 1 Advice about infant sleeping given to parents in the intervention group Parents were informed that: • Infant sleep is cyclical, with repeated episodes of arousal within a block of sleep. • Environmental factors or “cues of sleep” influence transitions to sleep and can be learned, altered and relearned. • Thus, sleep achievement is a “learned” skill. • Fatigue interferes with the performance of learned skills (ie, sleep achievement), and tearfulness in a well-fed neonate may reflect fatigue rather than pain. child was aged 6 weeks and again at 12 weeks; recording began on the first day after the child turned 6 weeks and then 12 weeks. The sleep diary allowed every 10- minute period over 24 hours to be scored for the child being asleep, awake, feeding or crying. Parents recorded data when conven- ient. • Parent-independent sleep cues are the most useful for developing “independent sleep skills”. 5-year review Parents were encouraged to minimise handling at the time of sleep achievement. It was recommended that parents focus on: • Allowing an infant to be in a “parent-independent” position at initial sleep achievement. • Regarding crying at sleep initiation as being due to tiredness and best handled by minimal parental response. • Leaving a settling infant for a minimum of 5 minutes before responding if the infant is crying; this time interval is to be extended by 5 minutes for each additional return visit to the child. 2 Flow of participants in the study of sleep performance 1001 families contacted (cid:127)\\\"\n",

The analysis relies on the Student Enrollment System in Colombia (SIMAT) data, covering the period from 2012 to 2020. This dataset offers valuable insights into student enrollment trends and characteristics, particularly for schools located near areas undergoing exploration and production (E\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\\\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m&P) activities. Additionally, the integration of the E\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\\\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m&P contracts in Colombia dataset, obtained from the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH), enables the examination of the relationship between contract signing dates and dropout rates during the preliminary phase. Furthermore, the georeferenced base of school locations provided by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) allows for spatial analysis and the investigation of the spatial distribution of schools in relation to E\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m\\\u001b[39;49m\u001b[38;5;124;43m&P contract areas. The comprehensive database employed in this study comprises an extensive range of columns that contain valuable information essential for understanding various aspects of the educational landscape. Notably, it provides insights into school dropout rates, gender distribution, and the total number of students. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive overview of enrollment status within the same school and sheds light on migration and immigration patterns. The inclusion of demographic data, such as socioeconomic stratum, age, subsidy type, and geographic details related to school campuses, further enriches the dataset.

Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial Medical Journal of Australia, 2005; 182 (5):215-218 This article is available from the Medical Journal of Australia at: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/effect-consultation-teaching-behaviour-modification- sleep-performance-infants PERMISSIONS This document has been archived with permission from the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia, ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the effect of a behaviour modification program, taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse, in improving sleep performance in newborn infants. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper. Intervention: A 45-minute consultation with a nurse 2–3 weeks after the birth, including a tutorial discussion on normal sleep patterns in newborn infants, supported by retained written material and, for infants with weight gain < 30 g daily, referral to their usual postnatal care provider. Main outcome measures: Hours of daytime sleep (0600–1800), night sleep (1800–0600) and total sleep per 24 h; and number of daily records with total sleep (cid:1) 15 h per 24 h, assessed by 7-day sleep diary at ages 6 and 12 weeks. Results: 268 families returned at least one sleep diary (137/171 intervention, 131/175 control), recording 3273 days. Two intervention infants were referred for low weight gain. Total sleep time was 15 h or more per 24 h on 62% of recorded days in the intervention group, compared with 36% in the control group (P < 0.001). At 6 weeks of age, intervention infants slept a mean 1.3 h per day more than control infants (95% CI, 0.95– 1.65), comprising a mean 0.5 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.32–0.69) and 0.8 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.56–1.07). At 12 weeks, intervention infants slept a mean 1.2 h per day more (95% CI, 0.94–2.14), comprising 0.64 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.19–0.89) and 0.58 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.39–1.03). There was no significant difference in crying time between the groups. Conclusions: A single consultation supported by written material in the first 3 weeks of a child’s life improves sleep performance at 6 weeks of age. This improvement is maintained at 3 months. METHODS Study population Families were recruited from birth notifica- tions published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the only South Australian daily newspaper, between October 1996 and March 1997. Contact details were obtained from the tele- phone directory. Parents were contacted by telephone within 2 weeks of their child’s birth and invited to participate in a study of sleep performance in healthy newborns. Those who agreed to participate were asked about MJA 2005; 182: 215–218 the baby’s health and medical history. Those who refused were not formally asked for their reasons. Inclusion criteria included delivery at 36– 42 weeks’ gestation, English-speaking mother, telephone in the home, and the mother intending to provide full-time care to her infant for at least the first 12 weeks after birth. A criterion for exclusion was admission of the infant to a neonatal inten- sive care unit for illness within the first 2 weeks after birth. Parents who agreed to participate were mailed a consent form. A sample size of 130 per group was determined, based on the minimum number of participants required to detect a predicted effect of a 30% increase in the proportion of children achieving 15 hours of sleep per 24 hours with a power of 90%.14 The period of 15 hours was chosen empirically as a refer- ence point based on clinical experience.

Correspondence: Dr Brian G Symon, 84 Shipsters Road, Kensington Park, SA 5068. brian.symon@adelaide.edu.au R ES E A R C H 1 Advice about infant sleeping given to parents in the intervention group Parents were informed that: • Infant sleep is cyclical, with repeated episodes of arousal within a block of sleep. • Environmental factors or “cues of sleep” influence transitions to sleep and can be learned, altered and relearned. • Thus, sleep achievement is a “learned” skill. • Fatigue interferes with the performance of learned skills (ie, sleep achievement), and tearfulness in a well-fed neonate may reflect fatigue rather than pain. child was aged 6 weeks and again at 12 weeks; recording began on the first day after the child turned 6 weeks and then 12 weeks. The sleep diary allowed every 10- minute period over 24 hours to be scored for the child being asleep, awake, feeding or crying. Parents recorded data when conven- ient. • Parent-independent sleep cues are the most useful for developing “independent sleep skills”. 5-year review Parents were encouraged to minimise handling at the time of sleep achievement. It was recommended that parents focus on: • Allowing an infant to be in a “parent-independent” position at initial sleep achievement. • Regarding crying at sleep initiation as being due to tiredness and best handled by minimal parental response. • Leaving a settling infant for a minimum of 5 minutes before responding if the infant is crying; this time interval is to be extended by 5 minutes for each additional return visit to the child. 2 Flow of participants in the study of sleep performance 1001 families contacted (cid:127)\\\"\u001b[39;49;00m\n\u001b[0;32m     33\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;124;43;03m output_text = {Paper title: Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial\u001b[39;49;00m\n\u001b[0;32m     34\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;124;43;03mAbstract summary: A behavior modification program taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse improved sleep performance in newborn infants.\u001b[39;49;00m\n\u001b[0;32m     35\u001b[0m \u001b[38;5;124;43;03mAuthors: B.

Effect of a consultation teaching behaviour modification on sleep performance in infants: a randomised controlled trial Medical Journal of Australia, 2005; 182 (5):215-218 This article is available from the Medical Journal of Australia at: https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2005/182/5/effect-consultation-teaching-behaviour-modification- sleep-performance-infants PERMISSIONS This document has been archived with permission from the editor of the Medical Journal of Australia, ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the effect of a behaviour modification program, taught to parents in a single visit to a trained nurse, in improving sleep performance in newborn infants. Design: Randomised controlled trial. Setting and participants: 268 families with normal newborn infants in the community, recruited between October 1996 and March 1997 from birth notices published in a South Australian daily newspaper. Intervention: A 45-minute consultation with a nurse 2–3 weeks after the birth, including a tutorial discussion on normal sleep patterns in newborn infants, supported by retained written material and, for infants with weight gain < 30 g daily, referral to their usual postnatal care provider. Main outcome measures: Hours of daytime sleep (0600–1800), night sleep (1800–0600) and total sleep per 24 h; and number of daily records with total sleep (cid:1) 15 h per 24 h, assessed by 7-day sleep diary at ages 6 and 12 weeks. Results: 268 families returned at least one sleep diary (137/171 intervention, 131/175 control), recording 3273 days. Two intervention infants were referred for low weight gain. Total sleep time was 15 h or more per 24 h on 62% of recorded days in the intervention group, compared with 36% in the control group (P < 0.001). At 6 weeks of age, intervention infants slept a mean 1.3 h per day more than control infants (95% CI, 0.95– 1.65), comprising a mean 0.5 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.32–0.69) and 0.8 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.56–1.07). At 12 weeks, intervention infants slept a mean 1.2 h per day more (95% CI, 0.94–2.14), comprising 0.64 h more night sleep (95% CI, 0.19–0.89) and 0.58 h more daytime sleep (95% CI, 0.39–1.03). There was no significant difference in crying time between the groups. Conclusions: A single consultation supported by written material in the first 3 weeks of a child’s life improves sleep performance at 6 weeks of age. This improvement is maintained at 3 months. METHODS Study population Families were recruited from birth notifica- tions published in the Adelaide Advertiser, the only South Australian daily newspaper, between October 1996 and March 1997. Contact details were obtained from the tele- phone directory. Parents were contacted by telephone within 2 weeks of their child’s birth and invited to participate in a study of sleep performance in healthy newborns. Those who agreed to participate were asked about MJA 2005; 182: 215–218 the baby’s health and medical history. Those who refused were not formally asked for their reasons. Inclusion criteria included delivery at 36– 42 weeks’ gestation, English-speaking mother, telephone in the home, and the mother intending to provide full-time care to her infant for at least the first 12 weeks after birth. A criterion for exclusion was admission of the infant to a neonatal inten- sive care unit for illness within the first 2 weeks after birth. Parents who agreed to participate were mailed a consent form. A sample size of 130 per group was determined, based on the minimum number of participants required to detect a predicted effect of a 30% increase in the proportion of children achieving 15 hours of sleep per 24 hours with a power of 90%.14 The period of 15 hours was chosen empirically as a refer- ence point based on clinical experience.

The sleep diary allowed every 10- minute period over 24 hours to be scored for the child being asleep, awake, feeding or crying. Parents recorded data when conven- ient. • Parent-independent sleep cues are the most useful for developing “independent sleep skills”. 5-year review Parents were encouraged to minimise handling at the time of sleep achievement. It was recommended that parents focus on: • Allowing an infant to be in a “parent-independent” position at initial sleep achievement. • Regarding crying at sleep initiation as being due to tiredness and best handled by minimal parental response. • Leaving a settling infant for a minimum of 5 minutes before responding if the infant is crying; this time interval is to be extended by 5 minutes for each additional return visit to the child. 2 Flow of participants in the study of sleep performance 1001 families contacted (cid:127)\\\"\n",
